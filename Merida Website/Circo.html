		<p id="Circus">The Roman Circus of Merida is an ancient enclosure for chariot races built in the
first century. It is 495 metres long and 95 metres wide.<br>
<br>
The races that took place in the circus, together with the shows in the
amphitheatre, were the two types of shows that were most popular with the Roman people.
These shows were often financed by wealthy people belonging to the
ruling class to commemorate some event or for electoral or propaganda purposes.<br>
