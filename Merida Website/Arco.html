		<p id="Trajan">The Arch of Trajan in Merida is a Roman monumental arch gateway
that receives this name because at the time it was thought to be a
triumphal arch.<br>
<br>
The arch has traditionally been known in the city as "Trajan's", without
any basis that relates it to that emperor.<br>
<br>
It is 15 meters high and 13 meters wide from one end to the other of its
buttresses. Its purpose is not clear, since having been exposed to
the elements, any inscriptions or decorations that could indicate it have been lost.
It is believed that it gave access to the first enclosure of the city.<br>
