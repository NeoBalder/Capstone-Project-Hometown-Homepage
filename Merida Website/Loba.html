		<p id="She-Wolf">The Capitoline Wolf was a gift from the city of Rome to Merida in 1997 in
recognition of it's Roman historical heritage.<br>
<br>
It is a life-size reproduction of the same statue exhibited in the museum of the
Capitol in Rome, 75 centimetres high and 113 centimetres wide. It represents Luperca,
the she-wolf that suckled Romulus and Remus, founders of Rome.<br>
